# Supabase Database Migrations

This directory contains the SQL file that defines your database schema.

## How to Apply the Migration

1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** section.
3.  Open the migration file (`migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`).
4.  Copy the entire content of the SQL file.
5.  Paste the content into the Supabase SQL Editor.
6.  Click **"Run"**.

This single script will create all the necessary tables and policies for the application. It is safe to run multiple times.
