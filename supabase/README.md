# Supabase Database Migrations

This directory contains SQL files that define your database schema. You can use these files to set up your Supabase database.

## How to Apply Migrations

1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** section.
3.  Open a migration file from this directory (e.g., `migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`).
4.  Copy the entire content of the SQL file.
5.  Paste the content into the Supabase SQL Editor.
6.  Click **"Run"**.

This will apply the changes to your database. It's a good practice to run migration files in order to ensure your schema is set up correctly.
