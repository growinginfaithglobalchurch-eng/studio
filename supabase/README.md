# Supabase Database Migrations

This directory contains the SQL files that define your database schema.

## How to Apply the Migrations

1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** section.
3.  Open `migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`, copy its content, paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor, and click **"Run"**.

This single script will create all the necessary tables and policies for the application. It is safe to run multiple times.
